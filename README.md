## Description

I wanted to get started on a professional portfolio for myself to prepare for my future job search and for potential employers when that time comes so that they can view it to get an idea of the work I've done and the skills I possess. A professional portfolio solves the problems of employers 1) not knowing the work that I have already done and am capable of in the future and 2) not knowing where to find those work samples. Having a professional portfolio allows me to have an organized, single location that shows a potential employer who I am and what I've done in the past (and thus, what I am capable of doing for them in the future) and provides them with access to how to quickly get in touch with me.

## Installation

Pull from my public github repository (https://github.com/adamgonterman/Portfolio_AdamGonterman.git) and clone on your local machine to create a directory that allows you to run the code yourself! You can also access my portfolio at the following URL:
